# Deepfake Detection Lab

## In this project, we also discover the project [Reasonable Computer Vision](https://github.com/users/kameleon-ad/projects/2)
1. The reasonable computer vision with LLM will discover what's happening in the vision model
2. On the other hands, it also discover what's wrong and also control the model with this by implementing the HRLF or AI-HRLF.
